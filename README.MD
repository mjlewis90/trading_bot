# ðŸŸ¢ Trading Bot (MVP)

This project is a **proof-of-concept trading bot** that demonstrates how to:

- Fetch and process market data
- Engineer trading features
- Train a machine learning model
- Generate trade signals
- Visualize and explore predictions interactively

The bot is designed around **S&P 500 price data**, CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT) reports, and AAII Sentiment Survey data. While currently focused on SPX/ETF indices, the design can be extended to other instruments in the future.

> **Note:**  
> This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is **not production-grade** and is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**.

## Workflow Overview

Below is a step-by-step workflow and description of each script:

### fetch_market_data.py

Description:  
Downloads historical SPY and VIX price data via Yahoo Finance and saves CSVs in ./data/raw/.

Run:
python fetch_market_data.py

### fetch_sentiment_data.py

Description:   
Fetches CFTC Commitments of Traders reports
AAII Sentiment Survey
Saves raw data and cleaned AAII CSVs.

Run:
python fetch_sentiment_data.py

### generate_features.py

Description:  
Loads price data, COT data, and sentiment data  
Computes moving averages, returns, volatility, net commercial positions, and bull-bear spreads  
Merges into a unified feature dataset  

Run:
python generate_features.py

Output:
./data/processed/features_<timestamp>.csv

### train_model.py

Description:  
Loads features  
Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict bullish/bearish signals  
Saves the trained model and feature names  

Run:
python train_model.py

Output:
Model artifact:  ./models/rf_model<timestamp>.joblib
Feature artifact: ./models/feature_names.txt

### predict_signals.py

Description:  
Loads the latest feature CSV and trained model  
Generates predicted signals and probabilities  
Saves signals to CSV  

Run:
python predict_signals.py

Output:
./signals/signals<timestamp>.csv

### cli_trading_bot.py

Description:  
Interactive command-line explorer  
Load signals and filter by:  
     Minimum prediction probability  
     Date ranges  
Inspect individual trade details  

Run:
python cli_trading_bot.py

### visualize_signals.py

Description:  
Plot historical price charts with bullish/bearish signals overlayed  
Optionally filter by date range  

Run:
python visualize_signals.py --start YYYY-MM-DD --end YYYY-MM-DD

Example:
python visualize_signals.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-07-10


## Recommended Workflow

1  Fetch raw market and sentiment data  
2  Generate features  
3  Train the model  
4  Predict signals  
5  Explore signals via CLI and visualization

| `fetch_sentiment_data.py` | Fetch COT and AAII sentiment                             |
| `generate_features.py`    | Create merged feature set                                |
| `train_model.py`          | Train Random Forest model                                |
| `predict_signals.py`      | Generate predictions and probabilities                   |
| `cli_trading_bot.py`      | Interactive terminal exploration of signals              |
| `visualize_signals.py`    | Generate visual candlestick charts with signals overlaid |


## Future Improvements

This MVP can be extended in several ways:

âœ… Integrate live data feeds (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca)
âœ… Support arbitrary tickers beyond SPY (ORCL, AAPL, etc.)
âœ… Add backtesting capability
âœ… Automate daily retraining and signal generation
âœ… Deploy as a web app or dashboard
âœ… Incorporate additional features (macro indicators, earnings, options data)
