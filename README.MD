# ðŸŸ¢ Trading Bot (MVP)

This project is a **proof-of-concept trading bot** that demonstrates how to:

- Fetch and process market data
- Engineer trading features
- Train a machine learning model
- Generate trade signals
- Visualize and explore predictions interactively

The bot is designed around **S&P 500 price data**, CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT) reports, and AAII Sentiment Survey data. While currently focused on SPX/ETF indices, the design can be extended to other instruments in the future.

> **Note:**  
> This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is **not production-grade** and is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**.
